# FoodClassification_usingDL

In this project, we present a deep learning-based system for classifying Indian food items based on their appearance in images. The system is based on the InceptionV3 model, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset. To adapt the model to the Indian food classification task, we used transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset of images and labels of Indian food items. The dataset consists of over 5000 images of Indian food items, comprising 20 categories.
Before training the model, we applied a number of techniques to the dataset to improve its quality and diversity. These techniques included brightness normalization, Sobel filter, and Principal Component Analysis. We also used data augmentation to create additional training examples by applying random transformations to the original images. This helped the model to learn to be invariant to various transformations and improved its ability to generalize to new data.
The trained model achieved a test accuracy of 84% and consists of a total of 315 layers. This system has the potential to be useful in a variety of different applications, including dietary tracking and food waste reduction. By providing an accurate and automated way to classify Indian food items, the system can help users to better understand and manage their dietary habits, and can also be used to improve food safety and reduce food waste.
